Applying for Maintainership
---------------

If you have successfully built for your device and want to apply for maintainership then drop in a message on support@havoc-os.com or fill out our [forms](https://forms.gle/6omkYBENoFbRHK9t8).
Our new maintainers are contacted just after the release of a new update , which happens bi-weekly.

## Code Review

For any code additions please check out our own [code review platform](https://review.havoc-os.com) based on gerrit by google

## Translations

For any translations please check out our own [crowdin project](https://translate.havoc-os.com)

## Adding features

Please make sure if you submit a patch/fix from another ROM that you maintain authorship. This is very important to not only us but to the entire open source community. It's what keeps it going and encourages more developers to contribute their work.

If you manually cherry pick a patch/fix please add the original author prior to pushing to our Gerrit. This task is very easy and is usually done after you commit a patch/fix locally.

i.e - Once you type in "git commit -a" the commit message and you have saved it, type in the following:

git commit --amend --author "Author <email@address.com>"

So it should look like this once you get all author's information:

git commit --amend --author "sukeeratsg <sukeerat@goindi.org>"
